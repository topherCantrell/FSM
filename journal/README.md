I made a light tent and took some good pics of the project. I cleaned up the word-art schematic.

Left to do:
  * Draw updated state machine
  * Clean up the code
  * Pull snippets from the code (3 or 4)
  * Write the article

I ordered two LED switches so I can run both pi and prop at the same time for a photograph. I ordered
the tic-tac-tome again -- also for a photo.

Finished up with the pi implementation. Now to make sure the propeller uses the updated state names.

Lots of work on the pi tic-tac-toe state machine. Only thing left is the game loop.

FSM in nodejs turns out to be easy. Good! The JSON notation makes for easy declarative
complex structures.

## 8/12/2016

New structure for the project. And this go-round I am using the Raspberry Pi and nodejs. This
technology will appeal to more people.
