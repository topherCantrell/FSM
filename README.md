# Tic Tac Toe State Machine

The bubbles in the diagram are the individual states. The purple function calls are made when the machine enters the state. The blue arrows show events and the target state.

## Splash Screens

This part of the state machine is an attract mode. The machine shows the individual letters for the words "TIC", "TAC", and "TOE" and sweeps the display clean with a line between. Press the button to start the game in the "PICKS" state.
